# The Digital Billboard

> *"I’ve always loved how unpredictable and beautiful the internet can be."*

## The Story

The Million Dollar Homepage by Alex Tew in 2005 is a good reminder of that unpredictable beauty.

Lately, I was tired of seeing billboards everywhere in Kochi, and even more tired after hearing how expensive they are. That made me wonder  **why is visibility forced, and why does it cost so much?**

What if the viewer choose what they want to see, so it benefits both the ad owner and the viewer.

That thought became a **Digital Billboard** — where anyone can own a space for a week.

Anyone can put up a billboard in Kochi.  
**Stand out on a digital one.**
